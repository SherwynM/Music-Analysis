## Overview
This project analyzes data from a survey on music listening habits and mental health. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visualizations, and a logistic regression model to predict mental health outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features such as:
- Age
- Primary streaming service
- Hours per day spent listening to music
- Mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD)
- Music genre preferences

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- plotly
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using:

    cd music-mental-health-analysis
    ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab or your local environment to explore the analysis and model.

## Results
The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Visualizations using Plotly and Seaborn to explore trends in the data.
- A logistic regression model to predict mental health outcomes based on music listening habits.
